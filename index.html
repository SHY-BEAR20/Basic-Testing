<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>When <strong><a href ="https://ng1lib.org/s/The%20Alchemist">The Alchemist</a></strong> was first published twenty-five years ago in my native Brazil, no one noticed.<br>
A bookseller in the north-east corner of the country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first week of it's release<br>
It took another six months for the bookseller to unload a second copy -and that was to same person who bought the first !<br>
 and who knows how long it took to sell the third.
By the end of the year,It was clear to everyone that The Alchemist wasn't working.<br>
My original publisher decided to cut me loose and cancelled our contract.They wiped their hands off the project and let me take the book<br>
with me.I was forty-one and desperate.</p>
